### About

>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” -- **Isaac Asimov**

Are computers Magic? I think so:

Casting spells (running applications), reciting encantations (shell commands), countless hours pouring over grimoies of esoteric knowledge (incomplete github repository wiki pages)...

...Okay, okay you get my point, aside from the cringey analogies Magic is a great way to describe how I see technology, I hope to share that viewpoint with **you** the reader by the ~~ramblings~~ writings found on this webzone.

To give you some context, Hi I'm [Joseph Fleet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-fleet-993821213/) author/admin for this site, currently I'm transitioning into a career in IT and spend my free-time breaking things and ~~sometimes~~ learning how to put them back together again.

Things I'll be talking about include:
- Operating Systems (with a focus on Linux)
- Troubleshooting
- Virtualisation
- CompTIA certifications
- And much more!
